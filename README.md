# <Horiseon Website update>

## Description

The previous website had old HTML code that was not up to current HTML semantic standards and therefore not accessible to all users. This new update provides all users with the ability to view the site, even with the use of assistive technology. While updating this site, I learned many elements of HTML and CSS and was able to practive effective troubleshooting to maintain the sites original appearance.
